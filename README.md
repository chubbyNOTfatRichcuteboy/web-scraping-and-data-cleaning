# web-scraping-and-data-cleaning
Web scraping and data cleaning in python using beautifulsoup, requests, pandas, and matplotlib


This is my first ever project/practice using libraries that aren't built in. This was a good experience to learn about how to install and use libraries.
The files with "TUT" in them follow tutorials from YouTube. However, they also have some small changes/additions that I added. For example, in walmartScraperTUT.py all functions with a comment are my own addition.

Beware of the .to_csv used in the programs, they are pathed to my local files
